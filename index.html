        <h1>Privacy Policy for AktuBaar</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: March 22, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to AktuBaar, an educational app designed to provide students with access to study materials, syllabi, question banks, and other academic resources for AKTU (Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly.</p>
        <p>By using AktuBaar, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you use the app, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name and Email Address</strong>: When you create a profile or update your profile in the app, you may provide your name and email address. This information is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences and is used to personalize your experience (e.g., displaying your name on the Home Screen).</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback and Issue Reports</strong>: If you submit feedback or report an issue through the app, we may collect the content of your message, along with your email address if you choose to provide it, to respond to your inquiry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect non-personal information that does not directly identify you, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Information about your device, such as device type, operating system, device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID on Android), and IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you interact with the app, such as pages visited, features used, and app usage patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized data about app usage, such as the number of users, session duration, and feature usage, to improve the app's performance and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advertising and Third-Party Ad Networks</h2>
        <p>AktuBaar uses third-party advertising services, such as Google AdMob, to display advertisements within the app. These ad networks may collect and use certain information to serve ads, which may include personalized ads based on your interests or non-personalized ads.</p>

        <h3>Information Collected for Advertising</h3>
        <p>To provide and improve our advertising services, the following information may be collected by us or our advertising partners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID on Android), device type, operating system, and IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Approximate location (e.g., city or region) based on your IP address or device settings, if you have granted location permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about your interactions with the app and ads, such as ad impressions, clicks, and app usage patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Data</strong>: Data provided by Google AdMob or other ad networks for ad targeting and analytics purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected to serve relevant advertisements, measure ad performance, and improve the overall user experience.</p>

        <h3>Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
        <p>The data collected for advertising purposes is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display advertisements within the app, which may be personalized based on your interests or non-personalized.</li>
            <li>Analyze ad performance and user engagement to optimize ad delivery.</li>
            <li>Support the operation and maintenance of AktuBaar by generating revenue through ad impressions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Consent for Personalized Ads</h3>
        <p>Before displaying personalized ads, AktuBaar requests your consent through the User Messaging Platform (UMP) in compliance with applicable privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). You can choose to allow or decline personalized ads during the consent process. If you decline, you will still see ads, but they will be non-personalized and based on contextual information rather than your personal data.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Sharing</h3>
        <p>To serve ads, we share the collected data with our advertising partners, such as Google AdMob. These partners may use the data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review Google AdMob's privacy policy for more information on how they handle your data: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>User Choices and Opt-Out Options</h3>
        <p>You have control over how your data is used for advertising:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalized Ads</strong>: You can manage your ad personalization settings through the consent form presented in the app or by adjusting your device settings (e.g., resetting your Advertising ID or opting out of ad personalization in your Android settings).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Interest-Based Ads</strong>: You can opt out of interest-based ads by visiting the following resources:
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Ad Settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">https://adssettings.google.com/</a></li>
                    <li>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI): <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/">https://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a></li>
                    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA): <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">https://optout.aboutads.info/</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information (CCPA)</strong>: If you are a California resident, you can request that we do not sell your personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@aktubaar.com">support@aktubaar.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that opting out of personalized ads does not stop ads from being displayed; you will still see non-personalized ads in the app.</p>

        <h3>Compliance with Privacy Laws</h3>
        <p>We are committed to complying with applicable privacy laws, including the GDPR, CCPA, and Google Play policies. We use the User Messaging Platform (UMP) to ensure that users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and other regions requiring consent are prompted to provide their consent for personalized ads. For users in California, we provide options to opt out of the sale of personal information as required by the CCPA.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
