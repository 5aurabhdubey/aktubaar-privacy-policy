        <h1>Privacy Policy for AktuBaar</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: March 17, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>AktuBaar</strong>, an educational app designed to help students access AKTU syllabus, question banks, and community features. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use our app. Currently, AktuBaar does not display advertisements, but we may introduce them in the future using Google AdMob, which will involve additional data collection and third-party sharing managed through the User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK. By using AktuBaar, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>

        <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Username and Email</strong>: When you first use the app, you may provide a username and email address. This information is stored locally on your device using <code>SharedPreferences</code> and is used to personalize your experience (e.g., displaying your username in the app and associating it with your community posts).</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback and Issue Reports</strong>: If you submit feedback or report an issue through the app, we collect your username, email, and the content of your submission to address your concerns and improve the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. User-Generated Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Community Posts</strong>: If you post in the Community section, we collect your username, the content of your post, and a timestamp. This data is stored in Firebase Firestore to facilitate user interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Device and Usage Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Data</strong>: We use Firebase (a Google service) for data storage and management. Firebase may automatically collect certain device information, such as device ID, app instance ID, and crash reports, to help us maintain and improve the app.</li>
            <li><strong>External Links</strong>: The app provides access to external websites (e.g., <code>aktu.ac.in</code> for AKTU information and syllabus). We do not collect data from these interactions, but the websites you visit may have their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data (Future)</strong>: We do not currently display ads. If we implement advertisements using Google AdMob in the future, third-party ad networks may collect device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, app usage data, and inferred interests for targeted advertising. This data collection will be managed through the User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK, and you will be asked for consent before such data is collected or shared.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>d. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not currently collect usage analytics or non-personal data beyond what is necessary for app functionality. If we introduce analytics or ads, we will update this policy and notify users.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: To display your username in the app and associate it with your community posts, feedback, and issue reports.</li>
            <li><strong>App Functionality</strong>: To store and display user-generated content (e.g., community posts) and educational resources (e.g., syllabus notes, question banks) via Firebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Improvement</strong>: To process feedback and issue reports to enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Maintenance</strong>: Firebase may use device information to provide crash reporting and ensure the app’s stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising (Future)</strong>: If we implement advertisements, we may use collected data to deliver personalized advertisements through Google AdMob, subject to your consent via the UMP SDK. This data will be used to improve ad targeting and performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
        <h3>a. Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Your username, email, and dark mode preference are stored locally on your device using <code>SharedPreferences</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Community posts, feedback, issue reports, and educational resources are stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad Data (Future)</strong>: If ads are implemented, advertising data may be stored by Google AdMob and its partners according to their privacy policies. This data will be managed through the UMP SDK and stored in compliance with applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We rely on Firebase’s security measures, including encryption in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest, to protect your data.</li>
            <li>If ads are implemented, Google AdMob and the UMP SDK will use industry-standard security practices to protect advertising data.</li>
            <li>We follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in the app.</li>
            <li>However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong>: We use Firebase for data storage, crash reporting, and potentially analytics (if enabled in the future). Firebase may process your data according to Google’s Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob and UMP SDK (Future)</strong>: We do not currently display ads. If we implement advertisements, Google AdMob and its advertising partners may collect and process data (e.g., Advertising ID, IP address, app usage) for ad delivery and personalization. This will be managed through the User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK, and you will be asked for consent. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a>) and AdMob’s Privacy Policy (<a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">support.google.com/admob</a>) for more details.</li>
            <li><strong>External Websites</strong>: The app links to external websites (e.g., <code>aktu.ac.in</code>). These websites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of AktuBaar, its users, or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <h3>a. Access and Deletion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can access and update your username and email directly in the app via the Profile section.</li>
            <li>To request access to or deletion of your data (e.g., community posts, feedback), please contact us at <a href="mailto:sddubey419@gmail.com">sddubey419@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days, subject to verification of your identity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Opt-Out and Consent</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current State</strong>: Since AktuBaar does not currently use ads or analytics, there are no opt-out options for such features.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Ads</strong>: If we implement advertisements, we will request your consent through the UMP SDK before collecting advertising data. You will be able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings (e.g., disabling Personalized Ads in Google Settings).</li>
                    <li>Revoke consent or adjust preferences via an in-app mechanism we will provide.</li>
                    <li>Details will be updated in this policy when ads are introduced.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can stop using the app to cease data collection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>AktuBaar is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do notknowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sddubey419@gmail.com">sddubey419@gmail.com</a> to have it removed.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>AktuBaar provides links to external websites, such as <code>aktu.ac.in</code>, for syllabus and informational purposes. These websites operate independently, and we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. If ads are implemented, we will provide links to the privacy policies of Google AdMob and other ad partners.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements, especially if we introduce advertisements. The updated policy will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. For significant changes (e.g., adding ads), we will notify users through the app or via email (if provided). Your continued use of the app after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Compliance with Laws</h2>
